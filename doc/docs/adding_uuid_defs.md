# Adding UUID definitions

The {{app_name}} comes with a list of predefined names and UUIDs for some well-known profiles. You can extend this list with custom definitions.

To extend the list of known UUIDs, complete the following steps:

1. To expand the device options for the local device, click the [**Device options**](./overview_and_ui.md#device-options) button.
2. Click **Open UUID definitions file**.<br/>
   The definitions file is opened in your default application for `.json` files.
3. Following the examples in the file, add your UUIDs, then save the file.
4. To load the changes, reconnect to the adapter or reload the application (CTRL+r).
