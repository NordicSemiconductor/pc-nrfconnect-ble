# Installing the Bluetooth Low Energy app

For installation instructions, see [Installing nRF Connect for Desktop apps](https://docs.nordicsemi.com/bundle/nrf-connect-desktop/page/installing_apps.html) in the nRF Connect for Desktop documentation.

!!! note "Note"
      From version 4.0.0, the Bluetooth Low Energy app is installed as a standalone application, for reasons of driver compatibility. The application functionality remains the same, and a proxy app is used from nRF Connect for Desktop. A desktop shortcut is also created automatically during the install process.

      To receive information on updated versions, you are recommended to use nRF Connect for Desktop to install, open and update the application. However, nRF Connect for Desktop's [**Uninstall**](https://docs.nordicsemi.com/bundle/nrf-connect-desktop/page/overview_cfd.html#post-installation-options) removes only the proxy app and [**Create shortcut**](https://docs.nordicsemi.com/bundle/nrf-connect-desktop/page/overview_cfd.html#post-installation-options) is no longer necessary, as a shortcut is automatically created.

      To uninstall the app, follow the steps appropriate for your operating system:

      - **Windows:** Open **Control Panel** and navigate to **Uninstall a program**. Find nRF Connect for Desktop Bluetooth Low Energy 4.0.0 and proceed to uninstall the application.

      - **Ubuntu:** Delete the folder `~/opt/nrfconnect-bluetooth-low-energy`. You may also delete additional config files from `~/.config/nrfconnect-bluetooth-low-energy`.

      - **macOS:** Move the nRF Connect for Desktop Bluetooth Low Energy 4.0.0 application to bin, from where it is located, normally placed inside the Applications folder.
