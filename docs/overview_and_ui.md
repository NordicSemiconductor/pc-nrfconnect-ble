It consists of the following main elements.

## Select Device

To the upper left, you can select a local serial device. You can use the selected local device to scan for Bluetooth Low Energy devices, which are listed in the side panel below.

You can switch between the following application tabs, using the navigation bar.

## Connection Map

This view is initially empty but will be populated with local and remote Bluetooth Low Energy devices when they are discovered.

## Server Setup

You can configure the local device's GATT (Generic Attribute profile) attribute table. Adding attributes to the server setup allows the local device to exchange data with a connected peer device.

## About tab

You can view application information, restore defaults, access source code, and documentation. You also can find information on the selected device, access support tools, and enable verbose logging.
